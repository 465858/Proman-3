# Welcome to Proman 3

## About this project

__Proman__ is a web application designed to help with the management of undergraduate dissertation projects. It is designed to help with the gathering of project descriptions from academic staff, student selection of projects from the annually published list, allocation of projects to students, and the ongoing management of undergraduate dissertation projects through the academic year. It was created by Nicolay Parashkevanov, a student of Mobile Communications and Internet Technology at Swansea University. __Proman__ is a Ruby on Rails application and was launched as a "beta" web application in late May 2009. Proman 3 is the second generation of this application, rebuilt from the ground up to exploit the latest innovations in modern Rails application development and to correct some of the major deficiencies of the first deployed version [Proman 2](http://github.com/cpjobling/Proman2).

The source code for the Proman project is licensed by an Apache 2 licence and hosted on  [githib.com](http://github.com/cpjobling/Proman-3).
